Extract all frame by yourself and place it on "frames" folder (or you can using exist pre-extracted frames it have), then run "badapple_generate_json.py" to make json file for the player to load. 
Play it using "player.py" in "player" folder. 
If you using your own data you may have to change some variable in "player.py" to make it work!
